			Covert Operations will be fast-paced, innovative, and unique joint-crisis committees which will explore how 
			governments interact behind the scenes of the United Nations. Gone will be the grandiose 
			statements about world peace; we will be dealing with the nitty-gritty of international relations and 
			spy-craft.

			As a committee, VEVAK's goal is to ensure that Iran's foreign and domestic interests are well represented 
			in the international sphere. Delegates are expected to safeguard Iran against the threats posed by enemies 
			of the state whilst cooperating with allied states to achieve Iran's domestic and international objectives. 
			Given the tensions resulting from Iran's nuclear program, preventing any setbacks in the nation's nuclear 
			development will be key to Iran's ascent as a global power. Delegates must also keep in mind that the world 
			is wary of Iran's power and thus must be prepared to combat anything from cyber attacks to political infiltration. 
			Your strategies will be crucial in determining Iran's position in the international community. Do not underestimate 
			the importance of this duty.
