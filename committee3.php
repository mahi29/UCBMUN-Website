			Famine is the foundation of every cultureâ€™s apocalypse, and has marred the history books of 
			countless nations. In 2012, the Committee on World Food Security warned that widespread food 
			riots could be seen across the globe in 2013 if abnormal weather conditions persisted. Inequalities 
			in the distribution of these worsening crop yields are rising amidst increasing political tensions and 
			inequalities in countries across the globe. Members of this committee will need to decide between 
			seeking long-term solutions to climate change and food system inequalities and seeking short-term 
			solutions that could have dangerous consequences. With vast disparities between the portion of 
			income spent on food and the global scope of the issue, agendas and proposed solutions will vary 
			greatly between delegates and undoubtedly contribute to an exciting debate.
