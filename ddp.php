		<h3> What is it? </h3>
		<p class="ddp"> Starting this year, the secretariat of UCBMUN intends to give the attendees of UCBMUN XVIII 
			an unparalleled educational experience about the world of MUN. We want to allow everyone 
			interested in debate and international relations to be able to compete at UCBMUN XVIII, 
			regardless of his/her prior MUN experience.
		</p>
		<hr class="contactHR" /><br />

		<h3> How will it be done? </h3>
		<p class="ddp">
			Our secretariat has spent countless hours in preparing instructional videos about MUN that cover 
			all the topics necessary to succeed at UCBMUN XVIII. We believe that understanding these 
			videos and the strategies mentioned in them would be sufficient for all attendees to learn how to 
			approach MUN conferences. We also understand that some things might be difficult to 
			understand just through the means of presentations; therefore, starting September 15, people who 
			have registered to attend UCBMUN XVIII will be able to speak to members of the Secretariat to 
			clarify doubts via Skype and G Chat.
		</p>
		<hr class="contactHR" /><br />		

		<h3> Will I be able to practice before UCBMUN XVIII? </h3>
		<p class="ddp">
			Absolutely! Participating in live debate is the best way to prepare for a real MUN conference. 
			Towards the end of this fall, we will host a one-day practice MUN conference at the Berkeley 
			campus for people who wish to practice their MUN skills before UCBMUN XVIII.
		</p>
		<hr class="contactHR" /><br />

		<h3> What is the cost of this program to me?</h3>
		<p class="ddp">
			This program is absolutely free for anyone who pays the registration fee of UCBMUN XVIII. You 
			will have access to all the videos, an opportunity to clarify all questions, and practice your MUN 
			skills at no additional charge.
		</p>
		<hr class="contactHR" /><br />

		<h3> I still don’t quite understand the program... Who should I contact for further information?</h3>
		<p class="ddp">
			Any questions about the Delegate Development Program (or UCBMUN XVIII, in general) can be 
			answered by our Chief of Staff – External, Akash Sharma. Feel free to send him an email at 
			<a href="mailto:cos-external@ucbmun.org"> cos-external@ucbmun.org </a> for any further clarification.
