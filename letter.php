		<p>Delegates, Faculty Advisors, Sponsors, and Visitors,</p>
		<p>
			It is my utmost honor to welcome you to UC Berkeley Model United Nations Conference XVIII 
			from March 6th until March 9th, 2014. This year UCBMUN will take place in the beautiful, albeit 
			foggy, city of San Francisco at the Hilton in the Financial District. Between Chinatown, the Financial 
			District, and North Beach, the hotel’s location will ensure every delegate has an opportunity to get a 
			feel for “the City by the Bay.” Here at the birthplace of the United Nations and at the crossroads of cultures, 
			we will, once again, host the longest running conference on the West Coast.
		</p>
		<p>
			This year our conference will host 13 different committees that stretch both geographic and traditional Model 
			United Nations dimensions. Our crisis committees, within which staff members change the geo-political landscape 
			mid-debate, will delve deeply into the issues of political violence in Pinochet’s Cabinet, Sri Lanka: 2006, and the 
			UNSC. Our crisis staff will also allow delegates to step into the shoes of executive boards members of the energy giant, Chevron, as they
			hope to win both profits and market share. Finally our crisis staff will be putting forth a completely new form of 
			committee at UCBMUN: Ad-Hoc. This committee’s background guide, positions, and even topic will not be revealed to delegates 
			until a short time before the conference. This committee will operate at intense speeds in order to provide experienced 
			delegates with a new challenge.
		</p>
		<p>
			Our conference will also feature an innovative four-way Joint Crisis, between the most powerful intelligence agencies 
			in the world. The CIA (USA), VEVAK (Iranian Intelligence), Mossad (Israel), and MSS (China) will all attempt to secure their 
			national interests while competing with allies and foes.  Finally, our committees selection will offer four traditional 
			Specialized Bodies - the European Court on Human Rights, an Emergency Session of the General Assembly, the 
			Nuclear Security Summit of 2014, and the very pressing Committee on World Food Security.

		<p>
 			This year to make UCBMUN XVIII more accessible for students of all experiences we’ve developed a new program to get everyone 
 			up to speed. Our Delegate Development Program focuses around the core understanding that not only do delegates need to understand 
 			the basics of debate and parliamentary procedure, but they must also practice what they learn. Our program will include presentations, 
 			videos, debate opportunities, and a last minute refresher just before our conference begins. Each of these tools will help new Model UN 
 			delegates feel more confident and be better prepared for UCBMUN XVIII, which in turn will improve the quality of the debate they can 
 			participate in.			
		</p>
		<p>
			We know that Model United Nations provides a great opportunity for teams to travel across the country to see our city and 
			for that reason we have planned a number of programming experiences that will remind you constantly why Tony Bennet “left his heart” 
			here. We will arrange tours of the city, allowing delegates the chance to see some of our special sites. We will also have evening 
			programming that will have you either traversing the hills or socializing with jazz music behind you.
		</p>
		<p>
			We can not wait to see you at this year’s conference and could not be more excited for the experience you will all gain from 
			attending our conference. If you have any questions about our conference feel free to contact me 
			at <a href="mailto:sg@ucbmun.org">sg@ucbmun.org</a>, or simply fill out the <a href="contact.php">sign up form</a> on our website.
		</p>
		<p >
			Yours Respectfully,
		</p>
		<p >
			Adam B. Spaulding
		</p>
		<p >
			Secretary-General, UCBMUN XVIII
