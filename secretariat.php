							 Adam Spaulding survived 12 different schools in 16 years
							 of schooling to call himself a senior this year. He grew up 
							 a military brat, the contributing factor to his love of History 
							 and Political Science as his parents dragged him (kicking and screaming) 
							 to political, historical, and geographic points of interest around the 
							 world. For Adam listening to pop-punk, socializing with his fraternity 
							 brothers, and applying to law schools constitute a good time. His 
							 involvement in Model UN started with a one-year stint on the European 
							 High School circuit and has since continued on the travel team here at 
							 Berkeley, but he still can’t decide if annoying crisis directors or 
							 creating a bloc as Libya or North Korea is his favorite aspect of Model 
							 UN. Most importantly, Adam cannot wait to see friends, meet new people, 
							 and provide a one-of-a-kind experience that he knows UCBMUN XVIII will be.
